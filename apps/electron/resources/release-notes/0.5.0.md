# v0.5.0 — Use Any LLM Provider

---

## New Provider Connections

- **Codex · ChatGPT Plus** — Sign in with your ChatGPT Plus or Pro subscription to use OpenAI's Codex models directly ([#2](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/2), [#44](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/44))
- **GitHub Copilot** — Connect your GitHub Copilot subscription with one-click device code authentication ([#49](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/49))
- **Google AI Studio** — Use Gemini models with your Google AI Studio API key. First-class support with native Google Search grounding built in. ([#240](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/240))
- **OpenRouter, Ollama & custom endpoints** — Bring your own API key for any OpenAI-compatible provider — OpenRouter, Ollama, or any custom endpoint ([#14](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/14), [#27](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/27))
- **Searchable model picker** — When a provider has many models, choose from three tiers (Best, Balanced, Fast) via searchable dropdowns with smart defaults

## Improvements

- **Provider icons** — Connection settings now show the upstream provider's logo and name so you can tell your connections apart at a glance
- **MCP sources work with all providers** — Your connected MCP sources are now proxied to non-Anthropic backends, so tools like Linear, GitHub, and Slack work regardless of which LLM you're using
- **Session list redesign** — Reusable entity-list primitives for a cleaner, more consistent UI
- **Skill metadata** — `requiredSources` and `icon` are now displayed in the skill info page and accepted by validation ([#290](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/290), [#249](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/249))
- **Copilot model filtering** — Only models enabled by your organization's policy are shown (92200095)

## Bug Fixes

- **Status icon colors** — Restored colors in the right-click context menu (6fa9b85b)
- **Windows paths** — Fixed backslash handling in workspace slug extraction (3d22e75f)
- **Model tier preservation** — Your selected models are no longer silently overwritten by provider defaults (1ddfe96f)
- **Windows build** — Fixed native module resolution (koffi), Vite OOM, and interceptor file packaging for reliable Windows builds (0ae044a2, ff791b03, 258e3e39)
- **Windows runtime** — Upgraded vendored Bun 1.3.5 → 1.3.9 to fix Windows crash (c4f46abc)
- **Pi SDK 0.55.0** — Bumped Pi SDK to fix streaming freezes and malformed OpenAI partial chunk JSON (718d4ad6)
- **Install scripts** — Fixed Windows and macOS/Linux install scripts to work without the version endpoint; scripts now fetch YAML manifests directly ([#273](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/273), [#276](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/276))

## Security

- **Web-fetch hardening** — Protection against SSRF, unbounded reads, and other edge cases (3904a786)
- **Explore mode** — Blocked `find -exec` and similar shell escape vectors ([#272](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/272))

## Infrastructure

- **Cloudflare migration** — Migrated R2 bucket and Workers to new Cloudflare account (55bb899e)
- **CI** — Windows builds now use `windows-latest` runner (c4ac80a6)

## Breaking Changes

- **Codex/Copilot backends consolidated** — The standalone Codex and Copilot backends have been replaced by a unified Pi SDK backend. Existing Codex and Copilot connections will need to be re-configured through the new onboarding flow.
- **Removed Claude OAuth via Pi** — The option to use a Claude subscription through the Pi backend was removed for Anthropic ToS compliance. Use the direct Claude Pro/Max connection instead.
